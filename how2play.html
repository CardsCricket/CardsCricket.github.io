        </header>
        <section>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The aim is to score as many runs as possible in 20 overs while avoiding getting all out.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deck of Cards:</strong> Use four standard 52-card decks.</li>
                <li><strong>Score sheets:</strong> Download from the Internet or draw one to add the team.</li>
                <li><strong>Players:</strong> Two or more players. One acts as the batsman and the other as the bowler.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <h3>Card Values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number cards (2-10):</strong> Represent runs (0,1,2,3,4 and 6 runs respectively).</li>
                <li><strong>Face cards (Joker, Jack, Queen, King, Ace):</strong> Removed from the deck.</li>
                <li><strong>Batsman is considered out:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During the run of the game, the bowler checkmates two playing cards played by the batsman with similar color and number cards.</li>
                        <li>The batsman is considered bowled out if three consecutive cards played by the batsman are checkmated by the bowler of any color card.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Combine and shuffle the four decks to arrive at 144 playing cards.</li>
                <li>The bowler (dealer) alternately deals one card at a time between the bowler and the batsman until 6 cards are dealt to the batsman, and the bowler receives 9 cards (additional 3 cards) to complete the first over.</li>
                <li>The batsman accumulates runs based on the difference in numbers on the cards played ball by ball, recorded in a scorebook.</li>
                <li>The batsman continues to bat until all 120 cards are drawn, they are out, or 20 overs are completed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overs:</strong> Introduce 10 overs per game (a set number of cards per over) for a shorter, structured game.</li>
                <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Form teams and take turns batting and bowling, similar to real cricket.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Keep a tally of scores over multiple innings or games to determine the winner.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>
                Player A (bowler/dealer) draws a ♥5 from their hand and plays it on the table. Player B places a ♥8, scoring runs based on two conditions: similar color card and higher difference in numbers. The score of 3 runs is determined by the AI bot.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Winning</h2>
            <p>The player or team with the most runs at the end of the 20 overs wins.</p>
