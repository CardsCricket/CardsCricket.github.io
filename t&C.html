            We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes to the law or regulatory requirements.
            </li>
            <li>Security or safety reasons.
            </li>
            <li>Circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
            </li>
            <li>Changes we make in the usual course of developing our Services
            </li>
            <li>To adapt to new technologies.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is a fast-moving field, and we are continually working to make our Services better for our users. This means that our Services can and will change over time. We may augment, modify, discontinue, or suspend any part of our Services at any time. We will work to provide advance notice to you where appropriate, but you acknowledge that this may not always be possible.
        </p>

        <p>The use of any of our Services after such an amendment to the Terms shall be considered an acceptance of all changes to the Terms. If you do not agree with the revised Terms, you must immediately cease any use of our Services.</p>
